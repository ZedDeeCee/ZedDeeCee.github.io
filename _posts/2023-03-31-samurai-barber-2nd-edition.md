2nd Edition of *Samurai Barber Versus Ninja Hairstylist* is now available in e-book and paperback form. 

This edition has a new Author's Notes section where I go into the science behind the science-fiction. It's now in the book because very few people actually read it when it was just a post on this site. With a new edition comes a new cover. Designed by [NM Design](https://nmdesign.org){:target="_blank"}, I think it looks absolutely amazing.

Check out the full cover for the paperback!
