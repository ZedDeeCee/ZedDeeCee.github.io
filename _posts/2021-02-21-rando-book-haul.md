Just found out that the integers page on random.org can generate repeated entries, which I don't really want. But found another page that [generates sequences](https://www.random.org/sequences/){:target="_blank"} instead, so that pages won't be repeated. First number of the random sequence between 1 and 212 is [Page 162 of January releases](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=digital-text&bbn=158591011&rh=n%3A158591011%2Cp_20%3AEnglish%2Cp_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A6602149011&s=daterank&dc&page=162&Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=16&Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=16&field-datemod=01&field-dateop=During&field-dateyear=2021&qid=1607034765&rnid=6602145011&unfiltered=1){:target="_blank"}.
