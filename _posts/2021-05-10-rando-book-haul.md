From the description and cover, this looks like another one of those sexy books I've been reading. First space orcs, then space elves, now space catgirls? Unfortunately, I got turned off by the infodump at the beginning.

Now, the space elves book also started with an infodump, but that was free while this is not.

There were some sentences with extra commas, and others with missing commas, that just made me think that this would be hard to read, like:

> After all, death is surely the most complicated mystery, that humankind faces.

I know I said that I wouldn't judge a book by its cover, but hot damn this cover is kick-ass! The writing is solid too. I bought it after a few paragraphs. The cover had nothing to do with it, I swear!
