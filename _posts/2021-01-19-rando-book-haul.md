Well, I've been busy playing Final Fantasy XI so I didn't have much time left over for this. But here I am, in the middle of January, looking to see if fate and circumstance can deliver unto me a book worth reading. First random page is [page 198 of December releases](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=digital-text&bbn=158591011&rh=n%3A158591011%2Cp_20%3AEnglish%2Cp_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A6602149011&s=daterank&dc&page=198&Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=16&Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=16&field-datemod=12&field-dateop=During&field-dateyear=2020&qid=1607034765&rnid=6602145011&unfiltered=1){:target="_blank"}.

## Page 198

# [The Long Dark](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Dark-Ian-Bott-ebook/dp/B08PK5LYQL){:target="_blank"} by Ian Bott

The writing is technically sound but I found the first two chapters boring.

# [The Art of Arms: A LitRPG / GameLit Adventure](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Arms-LitRPG-GameLit-Adventure-ebook/dp/B08PNNXCB5){:target="_blank"} by L Fenn

The writing is solid, but there's just something about the story I can't quite put my finger on that prevents me from buying this. Maybe I'm just not interested in the subject matter, which is funny because I've been spending a lot of time playing a MMO, so one would assume I would be interested in something like this.

# [Forever Homes](https://www.amazon.com/Forever-Homes-Marcy-Pusey-ebook/dp/B08PNTNNQ3){:target="_blank"} by Marcy Pusey 

I didn't think I would be interested in this. The speculative aspect is that it's an America where everything went to shit and the government got really big and overbearing, which doesn't seem likely to happen in America but hey, I'll buy it if the writing is good. And the writing seems to be good, at least based on the few chapters in the preview. I found myself hooked for some reason.
