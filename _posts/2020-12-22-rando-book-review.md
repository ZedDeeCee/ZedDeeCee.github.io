[![Yanked (David Brin's Out of Time Book 1)](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LtbZh2+0L.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JJ7HRDF){:target="_blank"}

This is one of the rare sci-fi that is hopeful about the future and it was just something I don't read a lot of. I found the "science" regarding why all the characters are teenagers a bit arbitrary, but I rooted for the characters anyway after suspending my disbelief.

And even though this book was tame compared to some of the grittier fare out there, there was still danger and the stakes were still high.

Overall, this book did so many things right and I enjoyed the read.

★★★★✰
