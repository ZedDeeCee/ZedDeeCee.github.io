## Page 123

# [ZANBUTU: THE UNIFIED AFRICAN GALACTIC CITY](https://www.amazon.com/ZANBUTU-UNIFIED-AFRICAN-GALACTIC-CITY-ebook/dp/B0911ZCSNP){:target="_blank"} by AYO MAKINDE

The first few sentences in the prologue could use some extra commas. Or maybe they should have been broken up into smaller sentences.

# [The Lunatic](https://www.amazon.com/Lunatic-Lauren-Wantz-ebook/dp/B08YS2PSQR){:target="_blank"} by Lauren Wantz

The description:

> Anglor is a Selenite, a man from the moon sent to Earth on a divine mission to make it a better world, but the catch is, it will be difficult to convince people of a better way because due to the fact that he will not give up his Selenite traditions, (including a suicide and re-brith every six motnhs,) he will be deemed insane, as "The Lunatic," as he, through becoming a renowned artist makes a plea to the planet Earth to "kill history," and start again without it.

That is just one sentence folks. There are also a few mistakes.

# [Survivor's Fate: The Gifted Book One](https://www.amazon.com/Survivors-Fate-Gifted-Book-One-ebook/dp/B08XW56R31){:target="_blank"} by AJ Thomas

There was a sentence in the description that I just couldn't get past:

> His journey will be questioned and he will have to ask himself if there is more to his story than revenge.

"His journey will be questioned"? 

# [Reality Junction](https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Junction-Alexander-Hawksville-ebook/dp/B08YGV393J){:target="_blank"} by Alexander Hawksville

The first sentence in the book:

> Hector Macdonald drove his electric ecovan into Pod City.

I really hate first sentences like these. It's literally: someone did something. So what?

The second sentence:

> A steady drizzle fell from the sky as he undid his seat-belt, switched of the ignition, and got out, and.

And? And?

# [The Augmented Man: (A Military Psychological Thriller)](https://www.amazon.com/Augmented-Man-Military-Psychological-Thriller-ebook/dp/B08YWPCFTW){:target="_blank"} by Joseph Carrabis

The description has a lot of unattributed quotes all praising the book, which made it look a little shady. The book itself starts with 4 different epigraphs, and it was at this point that I stopped.

# [Escape from the City: A Future Survival Tale](https://www.amazon.com/Escape-City-Future-Survival-Tale-ebook/dp/B08YWQ5SDQ){:target="_blank"} by Mic Roland

The book starts off with a note by the author, saying that sci-fi is not his usual genre. Okay...

Anyway, there is a clumsy infodump in the second paragraph which made me stop reading:

> The Matri (the ruling class of women who ran the City) provided his education, his job, housing, food, clothing, healthcare: everything, actually.

# [Sherlock Holmes, Stone, Rot, and Ruin](https://www.amazon.com/Sherlock-Holmes-Stone-Rot-Ruin-ebook/dp/B08YWL2XQR){:target="_blank"} by John Pirillo

In the description:

> A series of brutal murders engages Scotland Yard and Sherlock Holmes in pursuit of a killer who leaves a trail of broken and torn bodies as they assault one victim after another, bringing a new reign of terror and horror to London.

Scotland Yard and Sherlock Holmes assault one victim after another?

The book itself starts with a small epigraph that is attributed to "Arthur Conan Doyle's Journal", which I very much doubt because it contained sentences like this:

> Which side we choose to put to our lips can be a sudden impulsive one or a choice made with clarity and purpose.

A side can be a sudden impulsive one? What?

# [The Carter Project](https://www.amazon.com/Carter-Project-Kevin-Herrmann-ebook/dp/B08YWN9V74){:target="_blank"} by Kevin Herrmann

There was a lot of awkward phrases in the first chapter, e.g:

> He awkwardly sank into his chair as his heart thumped with embarrassment.

> The glow in his eyes disappeared.

I don't think it was a literal glow, but then again maybe it was. A lot of the sentences were vague like this.

# [The Life Inside My Mind: The Dark Figure's Request](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Inside-My-Mind-Figures-ebook/dp/B08YWHT3FM){:target="_blank"} by David McKee

I stopped at the first paragraph, which read:

> I was running, with a torch in hand, following down a narrow path. The flame atop the torch was hot and bright. My heart was beating fast, and I felt curiosity rise. The trees all around me were smouldering and the smoke burned by eyes.

I just thought that some of the sentences could have been better constructed.

## Page 102

# [RADICAL](https://www.amazon.com/RADICAL-Dan-Ransom-ebook/dp/B08ZKZ86DQ){:target="_blank"} by Dan Ransom

It starts off with the narrator telling us his biography, i.e his physical build, where he was born, etc. And there are few paragraphs of this.

## Page 203

# [Cerberus](https://www.amazon.com/Cerberus-John-Filcher-ebook/dp/B08XY4R22G){:target="_blank"} by John Filcher

It's written well, there are no mistakes, but I had trouble relating with the main character.

## Page 18

# [A Man With A Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Gun-Brandon-Luffman-ebook/dp/B08RCDMLYN){:target="_blank"} by Brandon Luffman

There was a grammatical mistake in the first paragraph.

# [The Wailing Asteroid](https://www.amazon.com/Wailing-Asteroid-Murray-Leinster-ebook/dp/B091DLSBX4){:target="_blank"} by Murray Leinster

It starts of very dry, like a prologue, where some people pick up an alien transmission. It lost me by the fifth paragraph or so.

# [The Portals](https://www.amazon.com/Portals-Harvey-Stanbrough-ebook/dp/B08YWZH34V){:target="_blank"} by Harvey Stanbrough

It's well written but I couldn't get into it. Maybe it's because the character in the first chapter doesn't have any clear motivations that I can relate to.

## Well, I couldn't find a book I wanted to buy...

I guess I'll just read the next book in the Subjugation series, [Insurrection](http://weavespinner.net/worlds_of_fel.htm), since it's free and I really want to know what happens next.
