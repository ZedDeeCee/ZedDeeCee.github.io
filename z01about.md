<p style="clear:right">This cute little baby grew up in Malaysia where he was exposed to three languages; English, Malay and Mandarin. Then he moved to Singapore when he was nine, where he studied English as a first language and Malay as second, because he couldn't read Chinese. It was a little strange but at least he was still somewhat cute.</p>

<p style="clear:left">Unfortunately, he isn't cute anymore. So he works as a programmer by day and tries to write stuff by night. Oh, and somewhere along the way he got diagnosed with autism.</p>
