<h1>Latest Book</h1>
<p>Books have words. Tens of thousands of them. Hopefully they have been arranged in a way that makes sense. Here is my latest book.</p>
<hr style="clear:both;rounded;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em">

{% assign book = site.books | reverse | first %}
<h2 style="clear:both">{{ book.title }}</h2>
<img src="{{ book.ImageLink }}" width="30%" height="auto" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px">
{{ book.content | markdownify }}

<hr style="clear:both;rounded;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em">

<p>If you liked one of my books and want to know whenever a new one is coming out, but you don't want to read the rest of my "blog", you should probably subscribe to my <a href="/feed/BookNews.xml">Books News RSS feed</a>.</p>
