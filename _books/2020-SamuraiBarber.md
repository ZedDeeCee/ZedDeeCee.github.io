*Change is in the hair*.

Ninjas are wreaking havoc by cutting people’s hair without their permission. Behind this follicular terrorism is a master ninja, the Ninja Hairstylist, whose chaotic hairstyle embodies the anarchy that is about to tear the city apart.

The Samurai Barber must step up and cut down the evil strands on the Ninja Hairstylist’s head. It is not just keratin that is at stake. The Samurai Barber must fight for one of the cornerstones of modern civilization; the freedom and self-determination to choose your own hairstyle.

Set in a far-flung biotechnological future, SAMURAI BARBER VERSUS NINJA HAIRSTYLIST is a genre-blending sci-fi tale that: **"On the surface, ... could be read as a campy martial arts parody; at a level below that, it is a sharp critique of capitalism and society; and even further down it is a story about two people reckoning with trauma, learning to give and accept love and forgiveness."** - [***BookLife***](https://booklife.com/project/samurai-barber-versus-ninja-hairstylist-51743){:target="_blank"}
