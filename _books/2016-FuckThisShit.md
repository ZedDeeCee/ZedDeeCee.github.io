**Learning not to give a fuck sometimes involves a lot of fucking.**

At twenty-nine, Zed has never been in love, much less a relationship. With a year to go before being a thirty-year-old virgin, he decides to pay for sex. But sex is not as easy as it seems. See, Zed has situational anorgasmia, which means that he can't orgasm during sex.

Zed tries to figure it out his sexual dysfunction. But he never would have guessed that making lots and lots of love would be crucial in learning of how to love himself.
