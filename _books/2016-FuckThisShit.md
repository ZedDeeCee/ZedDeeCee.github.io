Zed is unhappy. He is fast approaching thirty and he hasn't even had sex yet. He also told his friend that he would kill himself by the time he was thirty. Rather than die a virgin, he decides to pay for sex.

He pays for an hour. The girl is pretty. They have sex. The hour is over. He didn't come. What the fuck? Shouldn't it be easy for guys to have an orgasm? Isn't that the whole point of sex? What is wrong with him? What the fuck is this shit?

But, as he finds out more about himself and his sexual dysfunction, he learns that the best way forward is actually to not give a fuck about all this shit.
